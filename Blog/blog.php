            <p class="lead">People have an inherent urge to be connected to nature, referred to as "biophilia" by scientists. Unfortunately, the areas where we spend the majority of our days — our workplaces – have lost much of their connection to nature.</p>
            <p>According to studies, merely adding some greenery in the form of indoor plants can have significant positive effects on people and their workplaces. Including some green buddies about your workplace is a terrific way to boost productivity and give some happiness to your workplace.</p>
            <p>Certain plants can help you be more creative. Creative barriers are no joking matter. Whether you're running out of ideas or have been stuck on the same one for far too long, workplace plants can help. Bright colors and scents are essential for ensuring that your green companion has a favorable impact on your creativity.</p>
            <p>It's long been known that activating our senses may help us think more creatively, and taking the time to literally smell the roses can help you get out of a rut.</p>
            <p>Plants bring life to the workplace by adding color and texture. From a strictly aesthetic standpoint, plants help to integrate color, texture, and softness into the ordinary office. Similarly, if you want to maximize productivity during the usual working day, you must make your workspace as comfortable as feasible.</p>
